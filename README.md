This Python program is designed to predict the malignancy or benignancy of breast tumors using the University of California Irvine's breast cancer dataset (https://doi.org/10.24432/C5DW2B). The dataset includes various features derived from breast cancer biopsies, such as mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, and more.

The program utilizes a machine learning model (currently implemented with scikit-learn) to predict breast tumor malignancy. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and validated on another portion to ensure its accuracy.

After running the program, you will receive predictions for the malignancy or benignancy of breast tumors in the specified dataset. Actuallly is above 97%.

Feel free to contribute to the improvement of this breast cancer prediction program by creating issues or pull requests.
